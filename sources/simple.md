Chapter 47: Simple Representation Agreement (s. 9)
I. Introduction [§47.1]
The following precedent is for use in an emergency situation—perhaps your client has called from the hospital and is about to undergo surgery. Your client wants a representative to be able to make decisions if the client is not competent after the surgery. See the commentary at chapter 32 (Representation Agreements—Enhanced Powers for Health and Personal Care (s. 9)) and amend this precedent as necessary in light of your client’s wishes and circumstances.

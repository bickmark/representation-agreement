B.

The parties therefore agree as follows:

1) **REVOCATION OF ALL PRIOR REPRESENTATION AGREEMENTS**

<!--
The _Representation Agreement Act_ (British Columbia) uses the verbs "revocation" in Part 4. The Style Guide prefers the verb "terminate". The Representation Act has requirements to terminate a representation agreement (s. 27).
-->

1. ${ represented.name.first } hereby revokes and terminates all his or her prior representation agreements ${ represented.name.first } has entered into, effective immediately. ${ represented.name.first } shall use reasonable efforts to comply with the terms of termination under all prior representation agreements and under the Act. It is ${ represented.name.first }'s intention that each prior representation agreement is hereby revoked and terminated despite any failure of \${ represented.name.first } to comply with the terms of termination under the representation agreement or under the Act.

1. **APPOINTMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE**

   1. **Appointment.** \${ represented.name.first} hereby appoints the first listed Qualified person below, as his or her Representative (the "Representative"). If at any time the Representative ceases to be Qualified, the Represented appoints the next first listed Qualified person below as his or her Representative.

   ${ representative_name }
   ${ alternate_representative_name }
   \${ second_alternate_representative_name }

   <!--
   The _Representation Agreement Act_ (British Columbia), s. 29(1)(d) states that "A representation agreement ends... if the adult who made the agreement and the adult's representative are spouses, on the termination of their marriage or marriage-like relationship". Section 29(1.1) specifies that this can be overridden with specific language in the representation agreement. Sections 29(1.2) and 29(1.3) make clear the _Family Law Act_ (British Columbia) applies in respect of a determination under 29(1)(d) as to termination.
